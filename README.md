# Euler 100

I started doing this after coming across [Introducing The #ProjectEuler100 Challenge: the "Dark Souls" of Coding Achievements](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/projecteuler100-coding-challenge-competitive-programming/) in my news feed.

Truth be told, I'm naturally bad at coming up with "non-naive" solutions to these types of problems. I'm also no mathmateician. That's for sure.

I am especially terrible trying to work out problems involving matricies, they tend to make my head explode and make me feel really dumb sometimes ðŸ¤¯

Having said that, I'm constantly learning.

My initial attempts at solutions are almost always naive, relying on brute force at first. Then I try to see how things can be improved and/or optimized. I often come across solutions by others that do my head in. Never in a million years would I come up with some of these solutions on my own in the clever and brilliant ways that I've seen others have.

So working through these expercises is my attempt to understand and hopefully gain some mastery over some worthwhile things with the off chance that my brain works a little better with each new thing learned.

Leonhard Euler, who lived in the 1700's and after whom Project Euler was named, could most likely think circles around most folks today, if he were around. I find it amazing that Euclid, "the father of geometry", lived circa 300 BC and knew his maths problably better than most do now without the aid of technology.

Today, millions of people have more tech in their pockets (i.e. smartphones) than it took to send a man to the moon and use that tech to do not much more than post selfies on social media.

Imagine Euler's blog! Would he be considered an influencer today? I don't know, but I bet he'd be be a bad-ass software developer.
